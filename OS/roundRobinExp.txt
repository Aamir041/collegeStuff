In this implementation, the Process class represents a process with a process ID (pid), an arrival time (arrivalTime), a burst time (burstTime), and a remaining burst time (remainingTime).

The main function uses an array of processes and a time quantum to simulate the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm. 
The queue container from the <queue> library is used to hold the processes.

The waiting and turnaround times for each process are calculated as each process is run for the time quantum or until it completes. 
The min function from the <algorithm> library is used to determine the amount of time the process should run.

Finally
