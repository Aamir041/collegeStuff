Here's an explanation of how the script works:

The script prompts the user to enter three numbers and reads them into the variables num1, num2, and num3.

The script uses nested if statements to determine which of the three numbers is the largest, and assigns the value to the variable largest.

The script uses nested if statements to determine which of the three numbers is the smallest, and assigns the value to the variable smallest.

The script prints the values of largest and smallest.

Note that this script assumes that the user enters valid numeric input. If the user enters non-numeric input, the script may produce unexpected results or errors. To handle invalid input, you could add additional checks or error handling.
