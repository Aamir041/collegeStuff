Here's an explanation of how the script works:

The script prompts the user to select an operation using a multiple-choice menu and reads the user's choice into the variable choice.
The script prompts the user to enter two numbers and reads them into the variables num1 and num2.

The script uses a case statement to select the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the user's choice, and computes the result using the appropriate operator.

If the user selects division (option 4), the script checks if num2 is equal to 0, and prints an error message if it is.

The script prints the result of the arithmetic operation.
